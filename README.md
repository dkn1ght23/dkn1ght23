  <summary> <h3> My Journey from Code Enthusiast to Software Engineer </h3> </summary>
  
  My journey into software engineering started well before my professional career. I‚Äôve always been passionate about solving problems, which led me into competitive programming early on. Over time, I tackled more than 1200 problems across different platforms and participated in over 250 contests. Competitive programming helped me build a solid foundation in algorithms and data structures, and I earned recognition in the coding community of my university.
  
  After completing my B.Sc. in Computer Science & Engineering from Leading University, I began my professional journey as a Junior Software Engineer at Technext Limited, where I applied my skills to real-world projects like Eventgee, optimizing back-end performance with Express.js and improving user authentication, reducing response times by 40% and enhancing data security.
  
  In January 2024, I advanced my career by joining Hash Solution in Dubai as a Software Engineer (Remote), focusing on scalability and performance. I built microservices using GoLang and integrated them with React-based front-end systems, developing a responsive E-Invoice Solution with role-based access control (RBAC), blending front-end and back-end expertise to create a seamless product.
  
  From competitive coding to becoming a full-stack software engineer, my journey has been driven by a desire to solve complex problems and create impactful solutions. Every project I take on is a chance to learn and grow, and that‚Äôs what keeps me excited about this field.
